== Installation ==


1.	Copy daikosvideowidget.php to your /plugin/widgets/ folder

2.	Activate the widget on your plugin-page.

3.	Drag the Daiko's Video Widget to your sidebar and set a title + width and height (default width is 200px), and finally your own content (some videos are by default included but will disappear when you add own content).
 


To make your video-list just open the widget-control-panel and add 
your videos with the following syntax:



[MySpaceID/GoogleVideoID/YouTubeID]@[Title]@[Link]
[MySpaceID/GoogleVideoID/YouTubeID]@[Title]@[Link]
[MySpaceID/GoogleVideoID/YouTubeID]@[Title]@[Link]
[MySpaceID/GoogleVideoID/YouTubeID]@[Title]@[Link]


Without the brackets. Title and Link are optional and can be ommitted.


It is perfectly OK to mix Videos from different services and with different options.



Do not add a (Line brake) on the last line...



Good Luck!
